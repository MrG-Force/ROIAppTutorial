- On start up, the app will display a list of all the contacts. Each record is displayed inside a card with the contactâ€™s **name** and **phone number**.
- On top of the list you will see two text inputs. One allows you two search a user by **name** and the other by the employee's **Id** number.
- Bellow the two search inputs there is a drop-down list that will filter the list by the selected ROI department.
- In the right top corner of the screen, inside the header. There is a button to add a new contact to the list.

## 2.	Search by name
- To search for a user by her/his name, start typing the name in the text field, the app will automatically filter the contacts list as you type.

## 3.	Search by Id
- If you know the **Employee Id Number** of a specific Contact, just type it in the **Id search field** and **press enter** in the keyboard.
- If a Contact with that Id exists, the app will take you to the details page or will display a message if the contact was not found.
